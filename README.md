Denial of Service Attack simulation using ns2(network simulator version 2)
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack simulation using NS2 involves using the Network Simulator 2 (NS2) software to model and simulate different types of DoS attacks on a computer network and a useful tool for understanding how DoS attacks work and for evaluating the security of network systems

# What is DoS attack?
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash. In both instances, the DoS attack deprives legitimate users (i.e. employees, members, or account holders) of the service or resource they expected.
# What is NS2?
NS2 stands for network simulator (version 2). NS2 is a popular network simulation tool used by researchers and network engineers to study and analyze network protocols and behavior.
NS2 provides substantial support to simulate bunch of protocols like TCP, FTP, UDP, https and DSR.
Some of the benefits of using NS2 for DOS attack simulation:

It is a free and open-source software.
It is a powerful tool that can be used to simulate a variety of network protocols and applications.
It is a well-documented and well-supported software.
# Installation of NS2
1. Open a terminal in your system.
2. run the following command to update your system packages:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
3.To install ns2, run the the following command
sudo apt install ns2
4.To install network animator (NAM),run the following command  
sudo apt install nam
# How to simulate DoS Attack using NS2?
To perform a DOS attack simulation using NS2, you will need to:

•	Create a network topology in NS2.(creating udp packets)
•	Configure the network nodes to simulate the victim and attacker machines.
•	Write a TCL script to launch the DoS attack.
•	 Run the simulation using the appropriate NS2 command---ns dos.tcl
•	The results of the simulation can be analyzed to determine the impact of the DoS attack on the victim machine or network.
# Uses
1.	Test the robustness of network applications and services to DoS attacks.
2.	Develop and evaluate DoS attack mitigation techniques.
3.	Educate network administrators and security professionals about DoS attacks and how to respond to DoS attacks.
